## Common Student Questions
* What is the difference between an array and a hash?  

   A array is for an ordered array of items. A hash (or `hash`) is for matching some items (called "keys") to other items (called "values").

* What would I use a hash for?  

   When you have to take one value and "look up" another value. In fact, you could call hashes "look up tables."

* What would I use an array for?  

   Use an array for any sequence of things that need to be in order, and you only need to look them up by a numeric index.
