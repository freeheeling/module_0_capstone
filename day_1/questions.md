1. How do we get input from a user? What is the method that we would use?
</br> The method used to obtain input from a user is `gets`, which enables a user to input a line and return it as a value to the program. Calling `chomp` (i.e., `gets.chomp`) cuts off the trailing line break that is included as part of the value obtained.

1. Name and describe two common string methods.
</br> * One string method is `.length`, which counts the number of characters (including spaces) in a string. For example:
</br> name = "John Steinbeck"
</br> p name.length
</br> => 14

</br> * Another string method is `.split`, whereby a string is divided into pieces wherever a character space is encountered, returning an arrary. For example:
``` band = "Red Hot Chili Peppers"
p band.split
=> ["Red", "Hot", "Chili", "Peppers‚Äù]
```
